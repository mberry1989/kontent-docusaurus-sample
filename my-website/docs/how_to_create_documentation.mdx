Now that you know *why* to use Docusaurus with Kontent, the following pages on this site will walk you through creating a boilerplate Docusaurus + Kontent project from a template. We can break down the process into **three** high-level steps:

1.  Configuring Kontent
2.  Configuring the Sample
3.  Running the Site

This tutorial assumes you have a registered [Kentico Kontent](https://kontent.ai "Kentico Kontent") account as well as access to GitHub and an IDE like Visual Studio Code.
